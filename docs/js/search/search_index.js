Already prepared for the upcoming OAuth 2.1.\n\nCredits\n\njsrasign for validating token signature and for hashing\nIdentity Server for testing with an .NET/.NET Core Backend\nKeycloak (Redhat) for testing with Java\n\nResources\n\nSources and Sample: https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc\nSource Code Documentation: https://manfredsteyer.github.io/angular-oauth2-oidc/docs\nCommunity-provided sample implementation: https://github.com/jeroenheijmans/sample-angular-oauth2-oidc-with-auth-guards/\n\nBreaking Change in Version 9\nWith regards to tree shaking, beginning with version 9, the JwksValidationHandler has been moved to a library of its own. If you need it for implementing implicit flow, please install it using npm:\nnpm i angular-oauth2-oidc-jwks --saveAfter that, you can import it into your application by using this:\nimport { JwksValidationHandler } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc-jwks';instead of that:\nimport { JwksValidationHandler } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';Please note, that this dependency is not needed for the code flow, which is nowadays the recommended flow for single page applications. This also results in smaller bundle sizes.\nBreaking change in 9.1.0\nThe use of encodeURIComponent on the argument passed to initImplicitFlow and its Code Flow counterparts was mandatory before this version.\nSince that was considered a bug, the need to do so was removed.\nNow the reverse is true if you're upgrading from before 9.0.0: you need to remove any call to encode URI components in your own application, as the library will now do it for you.\nTested Environment\nSuccessfully tested with Angular 9 and its Router, PathLocationStrategy as well as HashLocationStrategy and CommonJS-Bundling via webpack. At server side we've used IdentityServer (.NET / .NET Core) and Redhat's Keycloak (Java).\nAngular 9: Use 9.x versions of this library (should also work with older Angular versions!).\nAngular 8: Use 8.x versions of this library.\nAngular 7: Use 7.x versions of this library.\nAngular 6: Use Version 4.x of this library. Version 4.x was tested with Angular 6. You can also try the newer version 5.x of this library which has a much smaller bundle size.\nAngular 5.x or 4.3: If you need support for Angular \nRelease Cycle\n\nWe plan one major release for each Angular version\nWill contain new features\nWill contain bug fixes and PRs\n\n\nCritical bugfixes on demand\n\nContributions\n\nFeel free to file pull requests\n\nThe issues contain some ideas for PRs and enhancements (see labels)\n\nIf you want to contribute to the docs, you can do so in the docs-src folder. Make sure you update summary.json as well. Then generate the docs with the following commands:\nnpm install -g @compodoc/compodoc\nnpm run docs\n\nFeatures\n\nLogging in via Code Flow + PKCE\nHence, you are safe for the upcoming OAuth 2.1\n\n\nLogging in via Implicit Flow (where a user is redirected to Identity Provider)\n\"Logging in\" via Password Flow (where a user enters their password into the client)\nToken Refresh for all supported flows\nAutomatically refreshing a token when/some time before it expires\nQuerying Userinfo Endpoint\nQuerying Discovery Document to ease configuration\nValidating claims of the id_token regarding the specs\nHook for further custom validations\nSingle-Sign-Out by redirecting to the auth-server's logout-endpoint\nTested with all modern browsers and IE\nToken Revocation according to RFC 7009\n\nSample-Auth-Server\nYou can use the OIDC-Sample-Server used in our examples. It assumes, that your Web-App runs on http://localhost:4200\nUsername/Password:\n\nmax/geheim\nbob/bob\nalice/alice\n\nclientIds:\n\nspa (Code Flow + PKCE)\nimplicit (implicit flow)\n\nredirectUris:\n\nlocalhost:[4200-4202]\nlocalhost:[4200-4202]/index.html\nlocalhost:[4200-4202]/silent-refresh.html\n\nInstalling\nnpm i angular-oauth2-oidc --saveImporting the NgModule\nimport { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { OAuthModule } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\n// etc.\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    // etc.\n    HttpClientModule,\n    OAuthModule.forRoot()\n  ],\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent,\n    HomeComponent,\n    // etc.\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [\n    AppComponent\n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Logging in\nSince Version 8, this library supports code flow and PKCE to align with the current draft of the OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice document. This is also the foundation of the upcoming OAuth 2.1.\nTo configure your solution for code flow + PKCE you have to set the responseType to code:\n  import { AuthConfig } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\n\n  export const authCodeFlowConfig: AuthConfig = {\n    // Url of the Identity Provider\n    issuer: 'https://demo.identityserver.io',\n\n    // URL of the SPA to redirect the user to after login\n    redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/index.html',\n\n    // The SPA's id. The SPA is registerd with this id at the auth-server\n    // clientId: 'server.code',\n    clientId: 'spa',\n\n    // Just needed if your auth server demands a secret. In general, this\n    // is a sign that the auth server is not configured with SPAs in mind\n    // and it might not enforce further best practices vital for security\n    // such applications.\n    // dummyClientSecret: 'secret',\n\n    responseType: 'code',\n\n    // set the scope for the permissions the client should request\n    // The first four are defined by OIDC.\n    // Important: Request offline_access to get a refresh token\n    // The api scope is a usecase specific one\n    scope: 'openid profile email offline_access api',\n\n    showDebugInformation: true,\n\n    // Not recommented:\n    // disablePKCI: true,\n  };After this, you can initialize the code flow using:\nthis.oauthService.initCodeFlow();There is also a convenience method initLoginFlow which initializes either the code flow or the implicit flow depending on your configuration.\nthis.oauthService.initLoginFlow();Also -- as shown in the readme -- you have to execute the following code when bootstrapping to make the library to fetch the token:\nthis.oauthService.configure(authCodeFlowConfig);\nthis.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocumentAndTryLogin();Logging out\nThe logOut method clears the used token store (by default sessionStorage) and forwards the user to the auth servers logout endpoint if one was configured (manually or via the discovery document).\nthis.oauthService.logOut();If you want to revoke the existing access token and the existing refresh token before logging out, use the following method:\nthis.oauthService.revokeTokenAndLogout();Skipping the Login Form\nIf you don't want to display a login form that tells the user that they are redirected to the identity server, you can use the convenience function this.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocumentAndLogin(); instead of this.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocumentAndTryLogin(); when setting up the library.\nThis directly redirects the user to the identity server if there are no valid tokens. Ensure you have your issuer set to your discovery document endpoint!\nCalling a Web API with an Access Token\nYou can automate this task by switching sendAccessToken on and by setting allowedUrls to an array with prefixes for the respective URLs. Use lower case for the prefixes.\nOAuthModule.forRoot({\n    resourceServer: {\n        allowedUrls: ['http://www.angular.at/api'],\n        sendAccessToken: true\n    }\n})If you need more versatility, you can look in the documentation how to setup a custom interceptor.\nToken Refresh\nSee docs: https://manfredsteyer.github.io/angular-oauth2-oidc/docs/additional-documentation/refreshing-a-token.html\nRouting\nIf you use the PathLocationStrategy (which is on by default) and have a general catch-all-route (path: '**') you should be fine. Otherwise look up the section Routing with the HashStrategy in the documentation.\nImplicit Flow\nNowadays, using code flow + PKCE -- as shown above -- is the recommended OAuth 2/OIDC flow for SPAs.

While the original standard DOES NOT allow this for SPAs, the mentioned OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice document proposes to ease this limitation. However, it specifies a list of requirements one should take care about before using refresh_tokens. Please make sure you respect those requirements.\nPlease also note, that you have to request the offline_access scope to get an refresh token.\nTo refresh your token, just call the refresh method:\nthis.oauthService.refresh();Automatically refreshing a token when/ before it expires (Code Flow and Implicit Flow)\nTo automatically refresh a token when/ some time before it expires, just call the following method after configuring the OAuthService:\nthis.oauthService.setupAutomaticSilentRefresh();By default, this event is fired after 75% of the token's life time is over. You can adjust this factor by setting the property timeoutFactor to a value between 0 and 1. For instance, 0.5 means, that the event is fired after half of the life time is over and 0.33 triggers the event after a third.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/silent-refresh.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/silent-refresh.html","title":"additional-page - Silent Refresh","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nRefreshing when using Implicit Flow (Implicit Flow and Code Flow)\nNotes for Code Flow: You can also use this strategy for refreshing tokens when using code flow. However, please note, the strategy described within Token Refresh is far easier in this case.\nTo refresh your tokens when using implicit flow you can use a silent refresh. This is a well-known solution that compensates the fact that implicit flow does not allow for issuing a refresh token. It uses a hidden iframe to get another token from the auth server. When the user is there still logged in (by using a cookie) it will respond without user interaction and provide new tokens.\nTo use this approach, setup a redirect uri for the silent refresh.\nFor this, you can set the property silentRefreshRedirectUri in the config object:\n// This api will come in the next version\n\nimport { AuthConfig } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\n\nexport const authConfig: AuthConfig = {\n\n  // Url of the Identity Provider\n  issuer: 'https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity',\n\n  // URL of the SPA to redirect the user to after login\n  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/index.html',\n\n  // URL of the SPA to redirect the user after silent refresh\n  silentRefreshRedirectUri: window.location.origin + '/silent-refresh.html',\n\n  // defaults to true for implicit flow and false for code flow\n  // as for code code the default is using a refresh_token\n  // Also see docs section 'Token Refresh'\n  useSilentRefresh: true,\n\n  // The SPA's id. The SPA is registerd with this id at the auth-server\n  clientId: 'spa-demo',\n\n  // set the scope for the permissions the client should request\n  // The first three are defined by OIDC. The 4th is a usecase-specific one\n  scope: 'openid profile email voucher',\n}As an alternative, you can set the same property directly with the OAuthService:\nthis.oauthService.silentRefreshRedirectUri = window.location.origin + \"/silent-refresh.html\";Please keep in mind that this uri has to be configured at the auth-server too.\nThis file is loaded into the hidden iframe after getting new tokens. Its only task is to send the received tokens to the main application:\n\n\n    \n        (window.opener || window.parent).postMessage(location.hash || ('#' + location.search), location.origin);\n    \n\nThis simple implementation within silent-refresh.html is sufficient in most cases. It takes care of the hash fragment as well as of the query string (property search). For edge cases you need to check if the received hash fragment is a token response. For this, please go with the following more advanced implementation:\n\n    \n        \n            var checks = [/[\\?|&|#]code=/, /[\\?|&|#]error=/, /[\\?|&|#]token=/, /[\\?|&|#]id_token=/];\n\n            function isResponse(str) {\n                var count = 0;\n                if (!str) return false;\n                for(var i=0; i\n    \nPlease make sure that this file is copied to your output directory by your build task. When using the CLI you can define it as an asset for this. For this, you have to add the following line to the file .angular-cli.json:\n\"assets\": [\n    [...],\n    \"silent-refresh.html\"\n],To perform a silent refresh, just call the following method:\nthis\n    .oauthService\n    .silentRefresh()\n    .then(info => console.debug('refresh ok', info))\n    .catch(err => console.error('refresh error', err));When there is an error in the iframe that prevents the communication with the main application, silentRefresh will give you a timeout. To configure the timespan for this, you can set the property silentRefreshTimeout (msec). The default value is 20.000 (20 seconds).\nAutomatically refreshing a token when/ before it expires (Code Flow and Implicit Flow)\nTo automatically refresh a token when/ some time before it expires, just call the following method after configuring the OAuthService:\nthis.oauthService.setupAutomaticSilentRefresh();By default, this event is fired after 75% of the token's life time is over. You can adjust this factor by setting the property timeoutFactor to a value between 0 and 1. For instance, 0.5 means, that the event is fired after half of the life time is over and 0.33 triggers the event after a third.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/working-with-httpinterceptors.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/working-with-httpinterceptors.html","title":"additional-page - Working with HttpInterceptors","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nInterceptors\nSince 3.1 the library uses a default HttpInterceptor that takes care about transmitting the access_token to the resource server and about error handling for security related errors (HTTP status codes 401 and 403) received from the resource server. To put in on, just set sendAccessToken to true and set allowedUrls to an array with prefixes for the respective urls. Use lower case for the prefixes:\nOAuthModule.forRoot({\n    resourceServer: {\n        allowedUrls: ['http://www.angular.at/api'],\n        sendAccessToken: true\n    }\n})You can provide an error handler for the urls white listed here by provding a service for the token OAuthResourceServerErrorHandler.\nTo implement such a service, implement the abstract class OAuthResourceServerErrorHandler. The following example shows the default implemantion that just passes the cought error through:\nexport class OAuthNoopResourceServerErrorHandler implements OAuthResourceServerErrorHandler {\n\n    handleError(err: HttpResponse): Observable {\n        return _throw(err);\n    }\n\n}Custom Interceptors\nFeel free to write custom interceptors but keep in mind that injecting the OAuthService into them creates a circular dependency which leads to an error. The easiest way to prevent this is to use the OAuthStorage directly which also provides the access_token:\nimport { Injectable, Inject, Optional } from '@angular/core';\nimport { OAuthService, OAuthStorage } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\nimport { HttpEvent, HttpHandler, HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest, HttpResponse, HttpErrorResponse } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport {Observable} from 'rxjs/Observable';\nimport { OAuthResourceServerErrorHandler } from \"./resource-server-error-handler\";\nimport { OAuthModuleConfig } from \"../oauth-module.config\";\n\nimport 'rxjs/add/operator/catch';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class DefaultOAuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {\n\n    constructor(\n        private authStorage: OAuthStorage,\n        private errorHandler: OAuthResourceServerErrorHandler,\n        @Optional() private moduleConfig: OAuthModuleConfig\n    ) {\n    }\n\n    private checkUrl(url: string): boolean {\n        let found = this.moduleConfig.resourceServer.allowedUrls.find(u => url.startsWith(u));\n        return !!found;\n    }\n\n    public intercept(req: HttpRequest, next: HttpHandler): Observable> {\n\n        let url = req.url.toLowerCase();\n\n        if (!this.moduleConfig) return next.handle(req);\n        if (!this.moduleConfig.resourceServer) return next.handle(req);\n        if (!this.moduleConfig.resourceServer.allowedUrls) return next.handle(req);\n        if (!this.checkUrl(url)) return next.handle(req);\n\n        let sendAccessToken = this.moduleConfig.resourceServer.sendAccessToken;\n\n        if (sendAccessToken) {\n\n            let token = this.authStorage.getItem('access_token');\n            let header = 'Bearer ' + token;\n\n            let headers = req.headers\n                                .set('Authorization', header);\n\n            req = req.clone({ headers });\n        }\n\n        return next.handle(req).catch(err => this.errorHandler.handleError(err));\n\n    }\n\n}\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/callback-after-login.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/callback-after-login.html","title":"additional-page - Callback after login","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nCallback after login\nThere is a callback onTokenReceived, that is called after a successful login. In this case, the lib received the access_token as\nwell as the id_token, if it was requested. If there is an id_token, the lib validated it.\nthis.oauthService.tryLogin({\n    onTokenReceived: context => {\n        //\n        // Output just for purpose of demonstration\n        // Don't try this at home ... ;-)\n        //\n        console.debug(\"logged in\");\n        console.debug(context);\n    }\n});\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/popup-based-login.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/popup-based-login.html","title":"additional-page - Popup-based Login","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nLogging in With a Popup\nThanks to a great community contribution, this library also supports logging the user in via a popup. For this, you need to do two things:\n\nUse initLoginFlowInPopup instead of initLoginFlow.\nCreate and configure a silent-refresh.html as described here *.\n\n* Please note this does not mean that you have to use silent refresh too.\nAlso, for your silent-regfesh.html, make sure you are also targeting\nwindow.opener and fall back to window.parent:\nPlease note: IE sets opener to null under specific security settings. This prevents making this work.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/custom-query-parameters.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/custom-query-parameters.html","title":"additional-page - Custom Query Parameters","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nCustom Query Parameters\nYou can set the property customQueryParams to a hash with custom parameter that are transmitted when starting implicit flow.\nthis.oauthService.customQueryParams = {\n    'tenant': '4711',\n    'otherParam': 'someValue'\n};\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/events.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/events.html","title":"additional-page - Events","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nEvents\nThe library informs you about its tasks and state using events.\nThis is an Observable which publishes a stream of events as they occur in the service.\nYou can log these events to the console for debugging information.\nA short snippet you could use:\nthis.oauthService.events.subscribe(e => console.log(e));Or a longer, more extensive version that logs them at different levels:\nimport { OAuthErrorEvent } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\n\n// ...\n\nthis.authService.events.subscribe(event => {\n  if (event instanceof OAuthErrorEvent) {\n    console.error(event);\n  } else {\n    console.warn(event);\n  }\n});Here's a list of the main events you might encounter:\n\ndiscovery_document_loaded is published whenever the service has retrieved the openid configuration and successfully saved the jwks information\ninvalid_nonce_in_state is published during tryLogin, when an access token has been requested and the state check was not disabled via the options, only in case the nonce is not as expected (see OAuth2 spec for more details about the nonce)\nuser_profile_loaded is published just before loadUserProfile() successfully resolves\ntoken_received is published whenever the requested token(s) have been successfully received and stored\nsilently_refreshed is published when the silent refresh timer has gone off and the library has also successfully refreshed the tokens (only applicable to Implicit Flow)\nsilent_refresh_timeout is published if the silent refresh timer has gone off but it takes too long to successfully refresh\nsession_error will only be published if the session checks encounter an error\n\nFor a full list of available events see the string based enum in the file events.ts.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/routing-with-the-hashstrategy.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/routing-with-the-hashstrategy.html","title":"additional-page - Routing with the HashStrategy","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nRouting with the HashStrategy\nIf you are leveraging the LocationStrategy which the Router is using by default, you can skip this section.\nWhen using the HashStrategy for Routing, the Router will override the received hash fragment with the tokens when it performs it initial navigation. This prevents the library from reading them. To avoid this, disable initial navigation when setting up the routes for your root module:\nexport let AppRouterModule = RouterModule.forRoot(APP_ROUTES, {\n    useHash: true,\n    initialNavigation: false\n});After tryLogin did its job, you can manually perform the initial navigation:\nthis.oauthService.tryLogin().then(_ => {\n    this.router.navigate(['/']);\n})Another solution is the use a redirect uri that already contains the initial route. In this case the router will not override it. An example for such a redirect uri is\n    http://localhost:8080/#/home\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/adapt-id_token-validation.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/adapt-id_token-validation.html","title":"additional-page - Adapt id_token Validation","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nConfigure/ Adapt id_token Validation\nYou can hook in an implementation of the interface TokenValidator to validate the signature of the received id_token and its at_hash property. This packages provides two implementations:\n\nJwksValidationHandler\nNullValidationHandler\n\nThe former one validates the signature against public keys received via the discovery document (property jwks) and the later one skips the validation on client side.\nimport { JwksValidationHandler } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\n\n[...]\n\nthis.oauthService.tokenValidationHandler = new JwksValidationHandler();In cases where no ValidationHandler is defined, you receive a warning on the console. This means that the library wants you to explicitly decide on this.\nDependency Injection\nYou can also setup a ValidationHandler by leveraging dependency injection:\n[...]\nproviders: [\n    { provide: ValidationHandler, useClass: JwksValidationHandler },\n],\n[...]\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/session-checks.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/session-checks.html","title":"additional-page - Session Checks","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nSession Checks\nBeginning with version 2.1, you can receive a notification when the user signs out with the identity provider.\nThis is implemented as defined by the OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 spec.\nWhen this option is activated, the library also automatically ends your local session. This means, the current tokens\nare deleted by calling logOut. In addition to that, the library sends a session_terminated event, you can register\nfor to perform a custom action.\nPlease note that this option can only be used when also the identity provider in question supports it.\nConfiguration\nTo activate the session checks that leads to the mentioned notifications, set the configuration property\nsessionChecksEnabled:\nimport { AuthConfig } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\n\nexport const authConfig: AuthConfig = {\n  issuer: 'https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity',\n  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/index.html',\n  silentRefreshRedirectUri: window.location.origin + '/silent-refresh.html',\n  clientId: 'spa-demo',\n  scope: 'openid profile email voucher',\n\n  // Activate Session Checks:\n  sessionChecksEnabled: true,\n}Refresh\nPlease note that the lib performs a token refresh when the session changes to get the newest information about the current session. When using implicit flow, this means you have to configure silent refresh; when using code flow you either need silent refresh or a refresh token.\nIf using refresh tokens, your Auth Server needs to bind them to the current session's lifetime. Unfortunately, the used version of Identity Server 4, shown in the docs and in the example applications, does not support this at the moment.\nEvents\nTo get notified, you can hook up for the event session_terminated:\nthis.oauthService.events.pipe(filter(e => e.type === 'session_terminated')).subscribe(e => {\n  console.debug('Your session has been terminated!');\n})\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/server-side-rendering.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/server-side-rendering.html","title":"additional-page - Server Side Rendering","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nServer Side Rendering\nThere is a great blog post that shows how this library can be used together with server side rendering:\nhttps://medium.com/lankapura/angular-server-side-rendering-for-authenticated-users-a021627fd9d3The sample for this can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/lankaapura/Angular-AspNetCore-Idsvr\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/configure-library-for-implicit-flow-without-discovery-document.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/configure-library-for-implicit-flow-without-discovery-document.html","title":"additional-page - Configure Library for Implicit Flow without discovery document","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nConfigure Library for Implicit Flow (without discovery document)\nWhen you don't have a discovery document, you have to configure more properties manually:\nPlease note that the following sample uses the original config API.

This ensures that all of the endpoints provided via the ID Provider discovery document share the same base URL as the issuer parameter.\nSeveral ID Providers (i.e. Google OpenID, WS02-IS, PingOne) provide different domains or path params for various endpoints in the discovery document. These providers may still adhere to the OpenID Connect Provider Configuration specification, but will fail to pass this library's discovery document validation.\nTo use this library with an ID Provider that does not maintain a consistent base URL across the discovery document endpoints, set the strictDiscoveryDocumentValidation parameter to false in your configuration:\nimport { AuthConfig } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\n\nexport const authConfig: AuthConfig = {\n\n  // Url of the Identity Provider\n  issuer: 'https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity',\n\n  // URL of the SPA to redirect the user to after login\n  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/index.html',\n\n  // The SPA's id.

This is the OAuth2/OIDC flow which was originally intended for Single Page Application. \nMeanwhile using Code Flow instead is a best practice and with OAuth 2.1 implicit flow will be deprecated*.\nimport { AuthConfig } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\n\nexport const authConfig: AuthConfig = {\n  // Url of the Identity Provider\n  issuer: 'https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity',\n\n  // URL of the SPA to redirect the user to after login\n  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/index.html',\n\n  // The SPA's id.

For this, the following sample uses the constructor of the AppComponent which is called before routing kicks in.\nPlease not, that this configuration is quite similar to the one for the implcit flow.\n@Component({ ... })\nexport class AppComponent {\n\n  constructor(private oauthService: OAuthService) {\n\n        // The SPA's id.

Using a client secret\n        // does not make sense for a SPA that runs in the browser. That's why the property is called dummyClientSecret\n        // Using such a dummy secret is as safe as using no secret.\n        this.oauthService.dummyClientSecret = \"geheim\";\n\n        // Load Discovery Document and then try to login the user\n        let url = 'https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity/.well-known/openid-configuration';\n        this.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocument(url).then(() => {\n            // Do what ever you want here\n        });\n\n  }\n\n}Configure Library for Password Flow (without discovery document)\nIn cases where you don't have an OIDC based discovery document you have to configure some more properties manually:\n@Component({ ... })\nexport class AppComponent {\n\n  constructor(private oauthService: OAuthService) {\n\n        // Login-Url\n        this.oauthService.tokenEndpoint = \"https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity/connect/token\";\n\n        // Url with user info endpoint\n        // This endpont is described by OIDC and provides data about the loggin user\n        // This sample uses it, because we don't get an id_token when we use the password flow\n        // If you don't want this lib to fetch data about the user (e. g. id, name, email) you can skip this line\n        this.oauthService.userinfoEndpoint = \"https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity/connect/userinfo\";\n\n        // The SPA's id. Register SPA with this id at the auth-server\n        this.oauthService.clientId = \"demo-resource-owner\";\n\n        // set the scope for the permissions the client should request\n        this.oauthService.scope = \"openid profile email voucher offline_access\";\n\n        // Set a dummy secret\n        // Please note that the auth-server used here demand the client to transmit a client secret, although\n        // the standard explicitly cites that the password flow can also be used without it. Using a client secret\n        // does not make sense for a SPA that runs in the browser. That's why the property is called dummyClientSecret\n        // Using such a dummy secret is as safe as using no secret.\n        this.oauthService.dummyClientSecret = \"geheim\";\n\n  }\n\n}Fetching an Access Token by providing the current user's credentials\nthis.oauthService.fetchTokenUsingPasswordFlow('max', 'geheim').then((resp) => {\n\n      // Loading data about the user\n      return this.oauthService.loadUserProfile();\n\n}).then(() => {\n\n      // Using the loaded user data\n      let claims = this.oAuthService.getIdentityClaims();\n      if (claims) console.debug('given_name', claims.given_name);\n\n})There is also a short form for fetching the token and loading the user profile:\nthis.oauthService.fetchTokenUsingPasswordFlowAndLoadUserProfile('max', 'geheim').then(() => {\n      let claims = this.oAuthService.getIdentityClaims();\n      if (claims) console.debug('given_name', claims.given_name);\n});Refreshing the current Access Token\nUsing the password flow you MIGHT get a refresh token (which isn't the case with the implicit flow by design!). You can use this token later to get a new access token, e. g. after it expired.\nthis.oauthService.refreshToken().then(() => {\n          console.debug('ok');\n})\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/configure-custom-oauthstorage.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/configure-custom-oauthstorage.html","title":"additional-page - Configure custom OAuthStorage","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nConfigure custom OAuthStorage\nThis library uses sessionStorage as the default storage provider. You can customize this by using localStorage or your own storage solution.\nUsing localStorage\nIf  you want to use localStorage instead of sessionStorage, you can add a provider to your AppModule. This works as follows:\nimport { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { OAuthModule } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\n// etc.\n\n// We need a factory, since localStorage is not available during AOT build time.\nexport function storageFactory() : OAuthStorage {\n  return localStorage\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [ \n    // etc.\n    HttpClientModule,\n    OAuthModule.forRoot()\n  ],\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent,\n    HomeComponent,\n    // etc.\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [\n    AppComponent \n  ],\n  providers: [\n    { provide: OAuthStorage, useFactory: storageFactory }\n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Custom storage solution\nIf you want to use a custom storage solution, you can extend the OAuthStorage class. Documentation can be found here. Then add it as a provider, just like in the localStorage example above.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/manually-skipping-login-form.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/manually-skipping-login-form.html","title":"additional-page - Manually Skipping Login Form","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nManually Skipping the Login Form\nFirst, try to use the loadDiscoveryDocumentAndLogin method instead of loadDiscoveryDocumentAndTryLogin. If you need more control, the following could be interesting for you.\nthis.oauthService\n    .loadDiscoveryDocumentAndTryLogin(/* { your LoginOptions }*/) // checks to see if the current url contains id token and access token\n    .(hasReceivedTokens => {\n        // this would have stored all the tokens needed\n        if (hasReceivedTokens) {\n            // carry on with your app\n            return Promise.resolve();\n\n            /* if you wish to do something when the user receives tokens from the identity server,\n             * use the event stream or the `onTokenReceived` callback in LoginOptions.\n             *\n             * this.oauthService.events(filter(e => e.type === 'token_received')).subscribe()\n             */\n        } else {\n            // may want to check if you were previously authenticated\n            if (this.oauthService.hasValidAccessToken() && this.oauthService.hasValidIdToken()) {\n                return Promise.resolve();\n            } else {\n                // to safe guard this from progressing through the calling promise,\n                // resolve it when it directed to the sign up page\n                return new Promise(resolve => {\n                    this.oauthService.initLoginFlow();\n                    // example if you are using explicit flow\n                    this.window.addEventListener('unload', () => {\n                        resolve(true);\n                    });\n                });\n            }\n        }\n    })\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/original-config-api.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/original-config-api.html","title":"additional-page - Original Config API","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nOriginal Config API\n\nThis describes the older config API which is nowadays only supported for the sake of backwards compatibility. \n\nTo configure the library you just have to set some properties on startup. For this, the following sample uses the constructor of the AppComponent which is called before routing kicks in.\nPlease note that the following sample uses the original config API. For information about the new config API have a look to the project's README above.\n@Component({ ... })\nexport class AppComponent {\n\n  constructor(private oauthService: OAuthService) {\n\n        // URL of the SPA to redirect the user to after login\n        this.oauthService.redirectUri = window.location.origin + \"/index.html\";\n\n        // The SPA's id. The SPA is registerd with this id at the auth-server\n        this.oauthService.clientId = \"spa-demo\";\n\n        // set the scope for the permissions the client should request\n        // The first three are defined by OIDC. The 4th is a usecase-specific one\n        this.oauthService.scope = \"openid profile email voucher\";\n\n        // The name of the auth-server that has to be mentioned within the token\n        this.oauthService.issuer = \"https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity\";\n\n        // Load Discovery Document and then try to login the user\n        this.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocument().then(() => {\n\n            // This method just tries to parse the token(s) within the url when\n            // the auth-server redirects the user back to the web-app\n            // It dosn't send the user the the login page\n            this.oauthService.tryLogin();\n\n        });\n\n  }\n\n}If you find yourself receiving errors related to discovery document validation, your ID Provider may have OAuth2 endpoints that do not use the issuer value as a consistent base URL. You can turn off strict validation of discovery document endpoints for this scenario. See Discovery Document Validation for details.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
